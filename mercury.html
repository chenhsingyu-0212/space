              <p>
                Mercury is the innermost and closest planet to the Sun among the eight planets in the solar system, 
                orbiting at a distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. It is a small, cratered planet. 
                After Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet, Mercury became the smallest of the eight major planets.

              <h2>Mercury's Surface Appearance</h2>
              <p>
                Mercury has a radius of about 2,440 kilometers, making it the smallest of the eight planets. How small is it? Mercury is even smaller than Ganymede, Jupiter's largest moon, and Titan, Saturn's largest moon! In photos, Mercury’s clear edges are visible, indicating that it does not have a thick atmosphere.

Mercury’s surface resembles the Moon's, with many impact craters, but unlike the Moon, it lacks the "maria" formations. Large cliffs and steep ridges are also quite common. Additionally, there are smooth plains on Mercury, likely remnants of ancient volcanic activity. The largest crater on Mercury is the "Caloris Basin," with a diameter of about 1,300 kilometers, roughly one-fourth the diameter of the planet itself, and it is thought to have been formed by an impact from an object about 100 kilometers in diameter.

              <h2>Mercury's Surface Environment</h2>
              <p>
                Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations, with daytime temperatures soaring to 430°C and nighttime temperatures dropping to as low as -170°C, making it an incredibly inhospitable environment for humans. It also has the largest temperature range of any planet in the solar system. However, recent radar observations and NASA’s MESSENGER mission have revealed that there might be ice present in the permanently shadowed craters at Mercury's north and south poles. This ice is believed to have been delivered by comets or asteroids and preserved in these shadowed regions.
