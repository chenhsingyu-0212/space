              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                Saturn is the sixth planet in the solar system and is renowned
                for its beautiful rings. It is approximately 9.5 astronomical
                units away from the Sun (about 1.4 billion kilometers), which
                can be intuitively described as a distance that could
                accommodate 100,000 Earth diameters. Saturn is the
                second-largest planet in the solar system, surpassed only by
                Jupiter. Like other gas giants, Saturn is primarily composed of
                gas, resulting in its very low density, making it the least
                dense of the eight planets. Additionally, Saturn belongs to the
                class of gas giants.
                <br />In Greek mythology, Saturn symbolizes the god of
                agriculture, and its English name "Saturn" is also related to
                Saturday.

              <h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
              <p>
                Saturn is a particularly unique planet, famous for its stunning
                rings, while its body resembles a wooden ball. Due to its
                gaseous composition and rapid rotation, Saturn exhibits features
                typical of a flattened planet. The equatorial radius differs
                from the polar radius by about 10%, making it the most
                "flattened" gas giant.
                <br />Compared to Jupiter, Saturn's surface patterns are less
                pronounced, but this does not diminish its unique charm.
                Satellite images cannot clearly display surface structures, yet
                they reveal fascinating features of Saturn's atmosphere.

            <div class="carousel-content">
              <h2>Surface Environment</h2>
              <p>
                It is impossible to inhabit Saturn; if one were to land there,
                they would fall into an endless "sea of hydrogen." The surface
                temperature is extremely low, below -150 degrees Celsius. The
                atmospheric movements of Saturn are remarkably similar to those
                of Jupiter; however, unlike Jupiter, most of Saturn's winds are
                westerly. Recent studies have shown that the planet's enormous
                hexagonal jet stream structure at the North Pole might be caused
                by strong polar winds, an intriguing phenomenon that continues
                to capture scientists' attention.
                <br />The atmosphere of Saturn also periodically exhibits
                swirling spots similar to Jupiter's spots, though Saturn's spots
                are usually white, thus referred to as "Great White Spots."

              <h2>The Structure</h2>
              <p>
                Saturn's internal structure is quite similar to Jupiter's, with
                a core made of rock and ice, surrounded by a layer of liquid
                metallic hydrogen and helium, of which hydrogen constitutes
                about 97% of its total mass. Saturn's magnetic field is
                impressively strong, about 20 times that of Earth's magnetic
                field. Recent observations indicate that the heat within Saturn
                comes not only from the Sun but also from radiative heat from
                its core, causing core temperatures to reach approximately
                10,000 degrees, surpassing the heat absorbed from the Sun.

              <h2>The Rings</h2>
              <p>
                Saturn's most striking feature is its magnificent rings, the
                most captivating planetary rings in the solar system. These
                rings are composed of countless small particles, predominantly
                ice. Gaps within the rings, such as the "Cassini Division"
                (discovered by Cassini in 1675) and the "Encke Gap," are formed
                by Saturn's moons. Recent research has revealed complex
                resonance phenomena within the rings, likely related to
                gravitational interactions between Saturn and its moons.
                <br />There are also so-called shepherd moons within the rings,
                which help maintain the structure of Saturn's rings through
                intricate gravitational interactions. The image below shows the
                rings of Saturn taken by Voyager 2 in 1981, illustrating how
                these small moons maintain the shape of the rings.

              <h2>Moons</h2>
              <p>
                As of 2024, Saturn has more than 83 confirmed moons, making it
                the planet with the second most moons in the solar system. Apart
                from Titan, the other moons have higher ice content, contrasting
                with the moons of Jupiter. Saturn's largest moon, Titan (with a
                radius of 2,575 kilometers), has an atmospheric pressure 1.5
                times that of Earth (about 1.5 atmospheres), which is quite rare
                in the solar system. Titan's low temperature (around -180
                degrees Celsius) and thick atmosphere make it a potentially
                habitable environment for life.

              <h2>Exploration of Saturn</h2>
              <p>
                The exploration history of Saturn dates back to the launch of
                Pioneer 11 on April 6, 1973. Subsequently, Voyager 1 and 2
                visited Saturn. Recently, the Cassini spacecraft was launched in
                1997 and successfully reached Saturn in 2005, conducting
                extensive studies on the planet and its moons, becoming the
                fourth spacecraft to explore Saturn. Discoveries made by Cassini
                have not only enhanced our understanding of Saturn's rings and
                moons but have also unveiled more mysteries about its
                atmosphere.

              <h2>Observation of Saturn</h2>
              <p>
                Saturn is one of the most beloved targets for amateur
                astronomers, with its brightness being nearly comparable to that
                of the star Vega. Through small telescopes, observers can
                clearly see Saturn's rings, captivating countless eyes with its
                "hula hoop" appearance. The rings of Saturn can span up to 43
                arcseconds, making them common observational targets. Notably,
                Saturn's ring opening and closing cycle is about 12 years,
                periodically revealing spectacular disappearances of the rings,
                a highly anticipated phenomenon for observers.
                <br />Titan, Saturn's moon, has a brightness of about magnitude
                8, making it challenging to distinguish, yet under favorable
                observing conditions, it can still be spotted. Although Saturn
                is relatively distant, its brightness slightly lower than
                Jupiter can reach up to magnitude 0.4 at its brightest,
                remaining very bright compared to other stars, providing
                observers with a rich observational experience.
