              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in the solar system,
                positioned between Saturn and Neptune. Its unique feature is
                that Uranus is the only planet that "lies on its side" as it
                orbits the Sun, with an axial tilt of approximately 98 degrees.
                This tilt causes its poles to sometimes point directly at the
                Sun. Discovered by British astronomer William Herschel in 1781,
                Uranus changed our understanding of the solar system's size and
                marked the beginning of modern astronomy. Due to its distance
                from the Sun, sunlight takes about 2.7 hours to reach Uranus,
                and it takes Uranus 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around
                the Sun.

              <h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
              <p>
                Uranus is famous for its distinctive blue-green hue, which is
                caused by methane in its atmosphere. This gas absorbs red light
                from the Sun and reflects blue-green light. As a gas giant,
                Uranus has no solid surface like Earth or Mars. While its
                appearance seems smooth and lacks visible rings or extreme
                weather patterns, Uranus does experience atmospheric activity.
                Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope in the late 20th
                century revealed cloud structures in its atmosphere, which
                appear as red spots in specially processed images. Further
                observations and analysis confirmed that Uranus also possesses
                faint ring structures, though they are much less prominent than
                Saturn's rings.

              <h2>Surface Environment</h2>
              <p>
                Uranus’ atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen and helium, with
                a small amount of methane. Methane is a key component that gives
                Uranus its beautiful blue-green color. The planet's surface
                gravity is about 8.9 m/s², slightly weaker than Earth's 9.8
                m/s². Due to its great distance from the Sun, Uranus has an
                extremely cold surface temperature of around -200°C, making it
                one of the coldest planets in the solar system.

              <h2>The Structure</h2>
              <p>
                According to current scientific knowledge, Uranus likely has a
                core composed of ice and rock, surrounded by thick layers of
                hydrogen, helium, and methane. Unlike Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus
                does not have a distinct metallic hydrogen layer, which
                contributes to its more irregular magnetic field. Uranus'
                magnetic field is tilted about 60 degrees from its rotational
                axis, a characteristic that has intrigued scientists and
                suggests unique formation and internal processes.

              <h2>The Rings</h2>
              <p>
                Uranus also has a ring system, first discovered by the Voyager 2
                spacecraft during its flyby in 1986. The rings of Uranus are
                narrower and darker than those of Saturn, with a total of 13
                known rings, each only a few kilometers wide. These rings are
                composed of dark particles that are difficult to detect in
                visible light. However, recent advancements in astronomical
                technology have allowed scientists to study the dynamic activity
                within Uranus' rings, which is more complex than previously
                thought.

              <h2>Moons</h2>
              <p>
                Uranus has 27 known moons, with five larger ones that are
                particularly notable: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and
                Oberon. Miranda, though only about 470 kilometers in diameter,
                stands out due to its striking geological diversity, including
                canyons up to 20 kilometers deep and large fault lines that
                suggest past tectonic activity. Titania, the largest of Uranus'
                moons with a diameter of approximately 1,578 kilometers, has
                relatively few surface features, which may indicate it underwent
                some form of geological reshaping. Scientists continue to study
                these moons to better understand the Uranian moon system and its
                evolutionary history.

              <h2>Observing Uranus</h2>
              <p>
                Because Uranus is about 2.9 billion kilometers from Earth, its
                dim light makes it difficult to observe with the naked eye.
                Astronomy enthusiasts need large telescopes and favorable
                viewing conditions to catch a glimpse of Uranus' small disk of
                light. In 2024, Uranus will pass through Pisces, offering one of
                the best opportunities for observation. It is recommended that
                astronomers check the planet’s current position and use
                professional astronomy software to accurately locate Uranus,
                greatly improving the chances of a successful observation.
                Recent studies of Uranus have focused on its climate changes,
                ring system, and moons. With the advancements in astronomy,
                particularly the deployment of next-generation space telescopes
                in the 2020s, scientists expect to gather more detailed data
                about Uranus, potentially unveiling new insights into this
                mysterious planet.
